    </div>
    <div class="dot common_word"><i></i><span>We may collect and disclose personal information, including your usage data, to governmental authorities or agencies, including law enforcement agencies, at their request or pursuant to a court order, subpoena or other legal process, if there is a good faith belief that such collection or disclosure is required by law;</span>
    </div>
    <div class="dot common_word"><i></i><span>We perform automated rules-based traffic management for the purposes of maintaining and improving our service. Applying these rules may require real-time analysis of Internet and data traffic including destination websites or IP addresses, originating IP addresses. However, no log is maintained regarding this information as it is a real-time process.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="dot common_word"><i></i><span>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</span>

We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety. </span>
    </p>
    <div class="dot common_word"><i></i><span>We may provide Your Information to our partners for the sole purpose of allowing them to conduct zuscloud business. </span>

We contractually require service providers to keep information secure and confidential and we do not allow our data processors to disclose your information to others without our authorization, or to use it for their own purposes. </span>
    </div>
    <div class="dot common_word"><i></i><span>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</span>
